# Linear Regression with two variable to predict the profit based on (size,bedrooms)  
## The code is divided into several parts :
* Read and plot the data.
* Separate the data into training and testing. 
* Convert from data frames to numpy matrices.
* implement the cost function and GradientDescent function. 
* Draw the line for Size vs Price
* Draw the line for Bedrooms vs Price
* Draw error graph between iteration and cost.
